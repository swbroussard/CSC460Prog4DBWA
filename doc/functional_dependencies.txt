Patient:
	- patientno -> nextVisit
	- patientno -> outstandingCost
	- patientno -> address
	* The Patient table does not include the name of the Patient, as a superkey
	  containing the patientno, givenname, and surname, would lead to a
	  functional dependency on address and their insurance provider, which 
	  would break 3rd normal form.

PatientName:
	- patientno -> givenname
	- patientno -> surname
	* See explaination under Patient table.

PatientInsurance:
	- patientno -> insuranceProv
	* See explaination under Patient table.

Appointment:
	- appointmentno -> patientno
	- appointmentno -> day
	- {appointmentno, patientno} -> day
	* Patientno is a primary key in this table to exploit the primary
	  key/foriegn key relation between Appointment and AppointmentProcedure. The
	  procedures used in an appointment are stored in a separate table,
	  otherwise appointmentno would functional depend on a set of procedures,
	  which would violate 1st normal form.

AppointmentProcedure:
	- No functional dependencies.
	* This tables serves to be a connection between Appointment and Procedure to
	  allow both tables to obey 3rd normal form.

Procedure:
	- procedureno -> name
	- procedureno -> cost
	* Length of procedure is ommitted from this table, as it would create a FD
	  from the super key {procedureno, name} -> length, which would violate 3rd
	  normal form. Similarly, the equipment used in each procedure is kept in a
	  separate table, as that would yield the a FD procedureno -> {equipment1,
	  equipment2, ..., equipmentN} which would violate 1st normal form.

ProcedureLength:
	- procedureno -> length
	* See explaination in Procedure.

ProcedureEquipment:
	- No functional dependencies.
	* This table serves to be a connection between Procedure and Equipment to
	  allow both tables to adhere to 3rd normal form.

Lab:
	- labno -> name
	* The list of equipment provided by each lab is not stored in this table, as
	  the primary key would have FDs to all equipment, which would violate 1st
	  normal form.

LabEquipment:
	- No functional dependencies.
	* This table serves to be a connection between Procedure and Equipment to
	  allow both tables to adhere to 3rd normal form.

Equipment:
	- equipmentno -> name
	- equipmentno -> cost
